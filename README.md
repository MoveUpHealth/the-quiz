##The Quiz

Using javascript and jQuery, I designed a short quiz that dynamically changes as the user submits their answers. There is a time limit for completing the quiz and a 5-second penalty for incorrect answers. At the end of the questions or when the time runs out, the user is shown their score and a scoreboard.

If the user scores higher than the lowest score on the scoreboard, they are aked for their initials, and their information is pushed into the screboard. The scoreboard is sorted by scores and then stored into local storage.
