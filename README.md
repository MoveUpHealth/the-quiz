##The Quiz

Using javascript and jQuery, I designed a short quiz that dynamically changes as the user submits their answers. There is a time limit for completing the quiz and a 5-second penalty for incorrect answers. At the end of the questions or when the time runs out, the user is shown their score and a scoreboard.

I am still working on the ability to collect the user's initials and to include them in the scoreboard if they are able to get a high score.
